## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
Modeling: Utilizes Gradient Boosting Classifier for binary classification (Hair Loss: Yes/No).
Evaluation: Precision-Recall curve, ROC curve, accuracy, and other performance metrics.
Multiclass Support: Adapted for multiclass classification with multiple output labels.
